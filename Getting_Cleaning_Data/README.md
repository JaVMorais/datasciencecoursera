### Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Introduction

These are my files for the final assignment of the course 'Getting and Cleaning Data' of the Data Science Specialization.

The objective of the assignment is to create an R script that takes <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">"data collected from the accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S smartphones"</a> and: 
<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>

Apart from the script 'run_analysis.R', this repo also contains:
*a codebook 'CodeBook.md';
*a .zip file 'UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip' with the data obtained form the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">"link"</a> provided above;
*a folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' with all the data sets required;
*a fodler 'output' where all the tidy data sets obtained from 'run_analysis.R' are stored.
